##How to use##

Each folder is a dependency for what i've used. i dont have time to write out everything so use your noodle on how to get them to work.

*   Fonts get installed as system fonts

*   Bspwm folder contains the dotfiles for both bspwm and sxhkd as they go hand-in-hand.

*   Kitty Folder contains the config for kitty.

*   picom contains the picom configuration.

*   Polybar contains a copy of my Polybar ini file. //Please note: this file gets stored under /etc/Polybar/  so remember to use root to make any moves or edits!.
